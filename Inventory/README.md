<h1 align="center"> Inventory System </h1>


#### This project is designed to create an inventory system in C++ using object-oriented programming. The system will enable the user to store and track information about products, including their quantity, price, and other details. The technologies used for this project include C++ programming language, and database management systems such as MySQL. Additionally, techniques such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Structured Query Language (SQL) will be used to create an efficient and robust inventory system.

## Technologies Required

- C++ programming language 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
- Structured Query Language (SQL) 
- Data Structures 
- Boost Libraries
- Standard Template Libraries (STL).
